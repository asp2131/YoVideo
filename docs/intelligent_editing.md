# Automatic Intelligent Video Editing Feature

## Overview
This document outlines the plan for implementing an automatic intelligent video editing feature that will analyze video content and automatically create edited versions based on various criteria.

## Goals
1. Automatically detect and remove silences/pauses
2. Create highlight reels based on content analysis
3. Generate social-media friendly clips
4. Maintain natural flow and coherence in edited output

## User Stories

### As a content creator, I want to:
- [ ] Automatically remove awkward pauses and filler words from my videos
- [ ] Generate highlight reels from longer videos
- [ ] Create multiple versions of a video for different platforms (TikTok, Instagram, YouTube)
- [ ] Apply automatic color correction and stabilization
- [ ] Add automatic captions and text overlays

## Technical Approach

### 1. Scene Detection
- **PySceneDetect** for shot boundary detection
- **Content-aware analysis** to identify key moments
- **Audio analysis** for speech and music detection

### 2. Editing Logic
- **Silence removal**: Detect and trim silent portions
- **Pacing control**: Adjust cut frequency based on content type
- **B-roll suggestion**: Identify segments suitable for B-roll
- **Auto-captions**: Integrate with existing transcription service

### 3. Output Generation
- Multiple output formats (16:9, 9:16, 1:1)
- Platform-specific optimizations
- Customizable presets

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Functionality
1. Basic silence/pause removal
2. Simple cut editing
3. Basic output formatting

### Phase 2: Intelligent Features
1. Content-aware editing
2. Automatic highlight detection
3. Platform-specific optimizations

### Phase 3: Polish & Optimization
1. Performance improvements
2. Advanced editing features
3. Customization options

## Technical Requirements

### Dependencies
- PySceneDetect
- MoviePy
- FFmpeg
- Existing transcription service

### Performance Considerations
- Processing time vs. quality trade-offs
- Memory usage for large videos
- Parallel processing capabilities

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for individual components
- Integration tests for full pipeline
- Performance benchmarking
- User acceptance testing

## Future Enhancements
1. AI-powered content analysis
2. Automatic thumbnail generation
3. Multi-camera sync and editing
4. Advanced color grading

## Open Questions
1. Should we implement our own ML models or use existing APIs?
2. How to handle copyrighted content in automated edits?
3. What level of customization should be exposed to users?

## Success Metrics
- Reduction in manual editing time
- User engagement with auto-edited content
- Processing time per minute of video
- User satisfaction scores
